## Overview

Discortics FAQ was a private support bot built exclusively for the Discortics™ community server. Developed and maintained solely by me, its purpose was to streamline user support, surface documentation, and extend Discortics functionality with plugin-like utilities. While not publicly available, it played a key role in improving community experience and internal workflows.

## Key Features

- **Smart Documentation Links**: Users could query common issues or commands and receive direct links to relevant documentation or guides.
- **Ticket Categorization**: Automated classification of support tickets based on content, helping moderators prioritize and respond more efficiently.
- **Bug Report Management**: Provided structured bug reporting flows, enabling users to submit reproducible issues with context.
- **Plugin-Like Extensions**: Added lightweight features that complemented Discortics, such as command wrappers, utility shortcuts, and internal tools for moderators.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript & Node.js**: For backend logic and bot interactions.
- **Discord.js**: To interface with Discord’s API and manage server events.
- **MongoDB**: As the primary database for storing ticket metadata and bug reports.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a bot that felt native to the Discortics ecosystem required careful design. I had to ensure that features didn’t conflict with the main bot, while still offering meaningful enhancements. Ticket categorization logic was particularly nuanced, requiring pattern matching and fallback strategies. Maintaining the bot solo also taught me the value of clean abstractions and internal documentation.

## Outcome

Discortics FAQ became a trusted tool within the community server, reducing support friction and improving moderator workflows. Though never intended for public use, it demonstrated how targeted tooling can elevate user experience and backend efficiency—even within a single server context.
