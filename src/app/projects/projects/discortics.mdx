## Overview

Discortics™ is a multi-purpose Discord bot used by communities at scale. I joined the project in 2021, started with **Discortics FAQ** in 2022, and later contributed during my backend internship at Vexvo. Since then, I’ve played a key role in the **migration from a JavaScript codebase to TypeScript**, while improving stability, performance, and developer ergonomics.

## Role & Timeline

- **2021:** Joined the project as Community Manager.
- **2022:** Built and maintained **Discortics FAQ**.
- **2023:** Backend intern at Vexvo; worked on core bot parts and prepared the JS→TS migration.
- **2024–Present:** Deep work across the repo—**engines, handlers, managers, and core modules**—plus ongoing improvements.

## Key Contributions

- Migrated and enhanced commands from **legacy JavaScript** to **TypeScript**.
- Helped move **in-memory caching** and ad-hoc storage to **Redis**, reducing memory pressure and improving consistency.
- Fixed bugs and refactored modules for maintainability and performance.
- Current focus: broader backend ownership (engines, handlers, managers) and ongoing quality improvements.

## Technologies Used

- **Core:** TypeScript, Node.js
- **Data & Messaging:** Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ

## Challenges and Learnings

- Replacing in-memory state with **Redis** required careful key design, expiration strategy, and idempotent operations.
- Upcoming challenge: moving selected features from **MongoDB to PostgreSQL** (schema design, query paths, and feature parity).

## Outcome

Discortics™ operates at substantial scale—**86k+ servers**—and the migration plus caching changes have improved stability and developer velocity. My contributions supported a cleaner TypeScript architecture and a more reliable runtime.
